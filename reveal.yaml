  - doc: |
      Originally, a physical device (keyboard + screen/teletype) for input/output. Today, it's a terminal emulator: software that provides a text-based interface to programs. It handles display, input, and emulation of standards like VT100, but it doesn't itself "understand" commands.

        Like a shell around a nut: surrounds and protects the kernel, exposing only controlled ways to interact.
